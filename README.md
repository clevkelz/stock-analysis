## Results
### Summary of Stock Returns and Daily Volume
Stock returns for Green Companies were strong in 2017, with only one of the 12 companies experiencing negative returns; however, this pattern reversed sharply in 2018, when only two of the companies had positive returns.  Total daily volume for these companies was generally higher in 2017 than in 2018 with the notable exceptions of Daqo New Energy Inc., Enphase Energy Inc., and Sunrun Inc.
